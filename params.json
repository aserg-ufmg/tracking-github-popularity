{"name":"Tracking-GitHub-Popularity","tagline":"Tracking GitHub Popularity","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nIn this article we make three contributions: \r\n\r\n* We propose a criteria to classify popular and very popular systems at GitHub.\r\n* We propose four growth patterns to describe the evolution of the number of stars of a system over time. \r\n* We check the importance of the stargazers measure, by correlating the number of stars with forks and client usage \r\n\r\nWe illustrate the application of our framework on a snapshot of GitHub, collected on May, 1st, 2015. \r\n\r\n### Measuring Popularity\r\n\r\nWe consider the top-24 programming languages with more repositories in GitHub, which are the languages classified as popular by the GitHub advanced search engine. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the number of stars in the top-1,000 repositories of such languages. \r\n\r\n![Stars by programming language (top-1,000 systems, from top-24 popular languages)](xxx)\r\n\r\nJavaScript is the language with the highest number of popular systems; in our sample of 1,000 JavaScript systems, the first quartile (bottom-25%), second quartile (median), and third quartile (top-25%) values are: 1,603, 2,274, and 3,820 stars. The median number of stars of the next five languages are: Ruby (793 stars), Objective-C (766 stars), Python (676 stars), Java (653 stars), and PHP (403 stars). \r\n\r\nWe consider popular the top-10% systems with more stars in our sample of 24,000 systems, which requires a system to have at least 1,459 stars (on May, 1st, 2015). The following table shows the number of popular systems on each language. Furthermore, we call very popular the top-1% systems with more stars, which requires a system to have at least 19,570 stars. The following table also shows the number of very popular systems, per programming language. Among these systems, 13 systems are implemented in JavaScript. \r\n\r\n###Popularity Growth Patterns\r\n\r\nFor evaluating popularity over time, we restrict the analysis to popular systems with at least 52 weeks (one year) in order to include reasonable historical data for evaluation. In this way, we study 2,138 popular systems (89% of our initial set of popular systems). For a given system, we define that Rt is its rank in our list of popular systems in the week t in a logarithm scale (base 2). Therefore, log2(1) + 1 ≤ Rt ≤ log2(2, 138) + 1 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 52. The ranks are considered in logarithm scale due to the right-skewed distribution in the number of stars of the the popular systems, as presented in Figure 2. The rank of the most popular system is 1. The earliest week is the week 1 (aka as OLD) and the latest one\r\nis 52 (aka as NEW ). We also define that RT OP and RBOT T OM are respectively the highest (best) and lowest rank (worse) of a system in the interval under analysis.\r\n\r\nWe propose four patterns of popularity growth: Sustainable, Fast, Slow, and Viral. These patterns are described next:\r\n\r\n**Sustainable Growth**: These systems sustained their ranking in the period under analysis, i.e., the number of stars they received in an one-year interval was sufficient to preserve their position in the ranking of popular systems. We use the following relation to express a sustainable growth:\r\n\r\n(RBOT T OM − RT OP ) < 0.25\r\n\r\nThe following figures show three examples of such systems: `rails/rails`, `facebook/Shimmer`, and `Automattic/socket.io`.\r\n\r\n**Fast Growth:** These are trending systems, which gained stars in a quantity that resulted in a relevant increase in their position in the ranking of popular systems, as captured by the following relation:\r\n(ROLD − RNOW ) > 1 ∧ (Rt+1 ≤ Rt) in at least 90% of the weeks t\r\n\r\nTable 2 shows the number of such systems per language. As can be observed, 100 systems (5%)\r\nmatched our definition for fast growth, including 44 systems in JavaScript and 18 systems\r\nin Java. Figures 3d to 3f show three examples of such systems: angular/angular.js,\r\ndocker/compose, and apache/spark.\r\n\r\n**Slow Growth:** These are systems receiving few stars on each week. As a result, they\r\nexperienced a relevant decrease in their rank position, as represented by the following relation:\r\n(RNOW − ROLD) > 1 ∧ (Rt+1 ≥ Rt) in at least 90% of the weeks t\r\n\r\nTable 2 shows the number of systems with slow growth per language. As presented in this table, 12\r\nsystems (0.5%) matched our definition for this pattern. Figures 3g to 3i show three examples\r\nof such systems: jquery/jquery, jquery-ui-bootstrap/jquery-ui-bootstrap, and\r\ndjango/django-old.\r\n\r\n**Viral Growth:** These systems experience a massive growth in their number of stars in a short period of time. Typically, viral growth results from word-of-mouth propagation in social networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc) or social news sites (Hacker News, Slashdot, Reddit, etc). In this paper, we consider that viral growth happens when a systems receives most of its stars (i.e., > 50%) in a single week. Table 2 also shows the number of popular systems classified as viral. We found 37 viral systems (2%) and JavaScript is the language with the highest number of such systems (13 systems). Figures 3j to 3k show three examples of systems with a viral growth. We can see that they received more than 1,300 stars in a single week, and very few stars (if any) in the other weeks. \r\n\r\n### Correlating Popularity with Forks and Usage\r\n\r\nTo clarify the credibility of the number of stars as measure for a system’s popularity, we investigate the correlation between this measure and two other ones: number of forks and number of clients.\r\n\r\n**Forks:** Figure 4a shows plots correlating a system popularity and its number of forks. A logarithm scale is used in both axes. The line represents the identity relation: below the line are the systems with more stars than forks, and above the\r\nline the opposite. Two facts can be observed in this figure. First, there is a strong positive correlation between stars and forks (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.55). Second, only a few systems have more forks than stars. As examples, we have a repository that just provides an example for forking a repository on GitHub (octocat/SpoonKnife) and a\r\npopular puzzle game (gabrielecirulli/2048), whose success motivated many forks with variations of the original implementation. Since the game can be downloaded directly from the web, we hypothesize that it receives most users’s feedback in the web and not on GitHub.\r\n\r\n**Clients:** To correlate client usage and stars, we focus on a restricted set of applications, composed by Node.js based libraries hosted on the NPM registry. We first retrieved the number of dependents of the popular JavaScript applications in our dataset, using the NPM API. We then manually inspected the top-100 applications in terms of dependents to select the\r\nNode.js-based modules. Figure 4b shows a plot correlating the values we found for number of stars and number of dependents.\r\nAs can be visually observed, there is a strong correlation between these two measures, with a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of 0.68.\r\n\r\n###Summing UP\r\n\r\nWe proposed a framework to assess and track the popularity of GitHub systems. Using this\r\nframework we found that:\r\n\r\n* JavaScript monopolizes more than one third of the popular applications on GitHub; the next five languages (Ruby, Objective-C, Python, Java, and PHP) are responsible for another third of the popular applications. \r\n* 21% of the popular systems have a sustainable growth; 5% have a fast growth; and less than 1% have a slow growth. We also found 37 systems with a viral behavior.\r\n* The number of stars of a system tends to correlate not only with the number of forks, but also with its effective usage by other client applications\r\n\r\n###More Info\r\n\r\nHudson Borges, Marco Tulio Valente, Andre Hora, Jailton Coelho.
