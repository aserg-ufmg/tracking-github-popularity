<p>We consider the top-24 programming languages with more repositories in GitHub, which are the languages classified as popular by the GitHub advanced search engine. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the number of stars in the top-1,000 repositories of such languages. JavaScript is the language with the highest number of popular systems; in our sample of
1,000 JavaScript systems, the first quartile (bottom-25%), second quartile (median), and third quartile (top-25%) values are: 1,603, 2,274, and 3,820 stars. The median number of stars of the next five languages are: Ruby (793 stars), Objective-C (766 stars), Python (676 stars), Java (653 stars), and PHP (403 stars). The five languages with the lowest median
number of stars are: Haskell (31 stars), Lua (24 stars), ActionScript (20), R (16 stars), and MatLab (4 stars)</p>

<p>We consider popular the top-10% systems with more stars in our sample of 24,000 systems, which requires a system to have at least 1,459 stars (on May, 1st, 2015). Table 1 shows the number of popular systems on each language. Furthermore, we call very popular the top-1% systems with more stars, which requires a system to have at least 19,570 stars. Table 1 also shows the number of very popular systems, per programming language. Among these systems, 13 systems are implemented in JavaScript. Therefore, 35% of the popular systems are in JavaScript, while the language has 54% of the very popular ones.
At the time of our analysis, twbs/bootstrap is the most popular repository, followed by angular/angular.js, and mbostock/d3.</p>
